#### **[2025.1.12] - Add inference script!**
#### **[2024.12.17] - CNNSum Dataset Release!**

We are excited to announce the release of the **CNNSum dataset**!

As outlined in **Section 3.1** and **Appendix E** of our paper, we have conducted a final round of manual cleaning to address any possible omissions. This process affects only a minimal number of samples, ensuring that the length statistics reported in our paper remain virtually unchanged.
